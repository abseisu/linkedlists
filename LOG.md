# Actual time to complete assignment
| Date | Time Started | Time Spent | Work completed |
| :--: | -----------: | ---------: | :------------- |
| 04/04 |      8:00pm |       2:00 | read assignment and drafted an outline of of pseudocode for how each function would be implemented. I also thought about helper functions I might need, and thought of implementing calculateDistanceToEnd separately |
| 04/04  |      10:00pm |       2:30 | implemented each function according to my outline. This did not take long at all, as it was just a matter of converting my thought-out high level code to C++ syntax. I became much more comfortable with C++ by the end of the time|
| 04/05 |      10:00am |       1:00 | Very minimal debugging. Used valgrind to ensure there weren't any memory issues. I just had to debug an issue with the formatting of my print functions and then I found a small bug in the getNextStation function that was preventing me from passing one test case. |

# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with no one.

# Discussion
This was a very enjoyable PSET. It felt very practically useful because it concerned implementing a solution to a real-life problem. I also feel like it was a great introduction to C++. Because the files were already implemented, it served as a great crutch with which I could become familiar with the syntax of the language. I also really liked that it integrated the same CS concepts we have been working on over the past few months. I feel much more comfortable with these, even in another language. I didn't encounter too many systemic challenges in this PSET, though printing formatting has always been a bit troublesome.
